# CSC-230
## Course Overview
This course approaches the topics related to computer organization and architecture in two ways: the "what", and the "how".
To answer the "what" question, the course presents the fundamental principles of computer organization and architecture. This leads to an introductory understanding of:
* the design of processors;
* the structure and operation of memory and virtual memory, cache, storage;
* pipelining;
* system integration;
* and peripherals.

The course also provides an introduction to issues of system performance evaluation and the relationship of architecture to system software.
Regarding the "how" question, the course provides an introduction to assembly language programming.
This leads to a direct and practical understanding of the inner working stages of a processor in relation to the rest of the system.
In addition, memory and cache management, interrupt processing and pipelining can be better understood.
Execution of software via assembly language and high level languages is explained in terms of system software tools which include assemblers, compilers, linkers, and loaders.
