# CSC-230
## Course Overview
This course approaches the topics related to computer organization and architecture in two ways: the "what", and the "how".

To answer the "what" question, the course presents the fundamental principles of computer organization and architecture. This leads to an introductory understanding of:
* the design of processors;
* the structure and operation of memory and virtual memory, cache, storage;
* pipelining;
* system integration;
* and peripherals.

The course also provides an introduction to issues of system performance evaluation and the relationship of architecture to system software.

Regarding the "how" question, the course provides an introduction to assembly language programming.
* This leads to a direct and practical understanding of the inner working stages of a processor in relation to the rest of the system.
* In addition, memory and cache management, interrupt processing and pipelining can be better understood.

Execution of software via assembly language and high level languages is explained in terms of system software tools which include assemblers, compilers, linkers, and loaders.
## Lab Topics
* Assembly language programming using MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)
* C programming tools (compiler, cross-compiler)
* Interface between high and low level languages
## Course Objectives
* Explain the concepts of RISC and CISC computer architecture, emphasizing RISC.
* Explain the elements of an instruction cycle.
* Summarize the instruction cycle.
* Write programs in assembly language using the MIPS RISC architecture as a case study.
* Program in the C language, using C as a cross compiler from a higher level language to an assembly language.
* Describe the function of compilers, linkers, loaders, and static and dynamic libraries.
* Examine the techniques of asychronous programming as would be needed for handling of traps and interrupts (i.e., for peripheral devices).
* Describe the characteristics of computer memory hierarchy systems, including performance issues of multiple memory levels.
* Describe the concepts of cache and virtual memory.
* Distinguish between memory mapping techniques.
* Explain how instruction pipelining speeds up over program execution, including describing various pipeline hazards.
* Compare and contrast the various processors and architectures defined in the current literature.
